<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Throughout the 21st Century, turnout across the United States has fluctuated significantly. For the sake of this blog post, voter turnout is described as the % of the amount of voters vs. the voting eligible population (18+ &amp; have the ability to vote). Taking data from the University of California Santa Barbara’s American Presidency Project, which collects data pertaining to presidential elections, we find that in the 2000 election, voter turnout was just 55.3%. Based on ElectProject.org, in the 2020 election, voter turnout was 66.6%; the highest since the 1900 presidential election.</p>
<pre><code>However, our focus is on the 2022 midterm elections &amp; understanding the impact of turnout on congressional races. For the sake of context, turnout in 2018 was 50.0%, contrary to 2014’s turnout at 36.7%. Both of these races have something in common: they are midterm elections. Midterm elections rarely rival presidential election turnout — but when they do, elections become significantly more interesting.

The old rule of thumb was that increasing turnout meant an increase in Democratic vote share. Many pundits have been under the assumption that democrats rely heavily on turnout in order to win their elections, whereas republicans are the baseline winners. Taking 2014 &amp; 2018 for instance — 2014 was an overwhelming red wave year, where Democrats were far from enthused &amp; didn’t turnout. 2018, on the other hand, was a significantly high turnout year, in which Democrats won back control of the House of Representatives. Though, it is not that simple.

In this blog, we will be exploring the impact of turnout on the midterm elections, though we will be considering more than just that. In addition to turnout, we will be mapping our data based on expert predictions and incumbency. In this blog post, we will be utilizing 2018 as our data point — given that we are only using data for all 435 districts for 2018. For incumbency, we will be treating that as a factor by congressional district, denoting incumbency by the incumbent party in the district (even if the race is an open seat). Finally, our expert predictions will be taken from the Cook Political Report, Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and Inside Elections. </code></pre>

Note on the map above: some of the districts are grayed out (only 3), this is due to a data error not being captured by the R code mapping the districts. These are all Republican victories – please view them as such.</p>
<p>Overall, Democrats captured 235 House seats, to the Republican Party’s 199. This was the most recent midterm election result.</p>

<p>Based on the results above, we find that expert predictions are not too far off from reality. The results vs. the expected are nearly identitcal – with very similar maps. There are some differences, but ultimately, expert predictions are quite reliable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, expert predictions are not always going to be the most “ethical” way to go about political predictions. In a sense, it is cheating, as the factors we include, such as GDP growth, presidential approval, incumbency, etc. are all taken into account through the expert forecasts. Thus, if we create a forecast with 5-10 variables impacting the prediction, while including an expert rating that already does that, we are doing our prediction a disservice.</p>
<p>Ironically, we are going to move into expert predictions + incumbency.</p>
</div>
<div id="model-including-incumbency-expert-predictions" class="section level2">
<h2>Model including incumbency + expert predictions</h2>
<p>To begin, let’s explore the correlation between the ratings from political firms &amp; the Democratic Party’s vote share:</p>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = Dem_votes_pct ~ avg, data = expertratings)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -34.557  -7.208  -0.767   5.473  24.972 
## 
## Coefficients:
##             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    
## (Intercept)  81.7734     0.9238   88.52   &lt;2e-16 ***
## avg          -6.7452     0.1982  -34.04   &lt;2e-16 ***
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 11.05 on 434 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.7275, Adjusted R-squared:  0.7268 
## F-statistic:  1159 on 1 and 434 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16</code></pre>
<p>Based on the found R^2 of 0.7275, we can conclude that there is correlation between Democratic Party vote share and expert rating. This correlation indicates that expert ratings are good at providing helpful insight into the outcome of elections on the Congressional level.</p>
<p>At this point in the blog post, we will be shifting from predictions, to rather analyzing the correlation between our extended variables and the 2018 election results. This is because I do not plan to include any of the future variables in my final prediction – however, knowing how they are connected to Democratic Party vote share is equally fascinating as it is important. Now, let’s throw in the factor of incumbency into the mix in addition to expert predictions:</p>
<pre><code>## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = Dem_votes_pct ~ avg + IncumbentParty, data = newdatafr)
## 
## Residuals:
##     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
## -34.948  -6.166  -0.558   5.257  24.224 
## 
## Coefficients:
##                Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    
## (Intercept)     81.5211     0.9145  89.144  &lt; 2e-16 ***
## avg             -5.7455     0.3667 -15.666  &lt; 2e-16 ***
## IncumbentParty  -6.3544     1.9724  -3.222  0.00137 ** 
## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1
## 
## Residual standard error: 10.92 on 435 degrees of freedom
## Multiple R-squared:  0.7334, Adjusted R-squared:  0.7322 
## F-statistic: 598.4 on 2 and 435 DF,  p-value: &lt; 2.2e-16</code></pre>
<p>The R^2 in this was 0.7334, which was an increase from the previous R^2 value under just expert predictions. By adding in the incumbent party (currently holding the seat), the R^2 shows a clear correlation between the two variables when added together. This is to be expected, as mentioned previously, as expert predictions practically cover forecasters on many fronts.</p>
<p>I expect it to be the same as we add in the factor of turnout.</p>
